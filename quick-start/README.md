# Concourse Quick start

This is for getting concourse up and running quickly without any setup. It should only be used for local testing and trying out concourse.

## Instructions

From the quick-start folder run docker-compose up then go to [http://192.168.99.100:8080](http://192.168.99.100:8080)

You can edit the compose file to change the URL and login/password as needed.

Defaults are the following:

* `URL` [http://192.168.99.100:8080](http://192.168.99.100:8080)
* `login` concourse
* `password` password
